                This application consists of Akan names which are derived from <strong>Ghanaian
                culture</strong> based on the week they were born and the days. Most people know their
                birthday according to the week or day they were born, often if it was a holiday.
                However, Ghanaians remember the day according to their week days. For example, if a male
                is born on Sunday, his name will be <em>'Kwasi'</em>, and if a female is born on Sunday,
                she will be called <em>'Akosua'</em>. This is different from other African cultures and also naming
                children.
