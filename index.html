            This application consist of Akan names which are derrived from Ghanian 
            culture from the week they were born and also the days.Most people know their 
            birthday according to the week or day they were born,either was an holiday 
            but Ghanian they remember the day according to their week days,ie;If one is a male 
            and was born on Sunday his name will be 'Kwasi',and if is a female born on sunday 
            she will be called 'Akosua'.Which is different from our african culture and also naming 
            children.
