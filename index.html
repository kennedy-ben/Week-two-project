        This application consist of Akan names which are derrived from<strong>Ghanian
        culture</strong> from the week they were born and also the days.Most people know their
        birthday according to the week or day they were born,either was an holiday
        but Ghanian they remember the day according to their week days,ie;If one is a male
        and was born on Sunday his name will be <em>'Kwasi'</em>,and if is a female born on sunday
        she will be called <em>'Akosua'</em>.Which is different from our african culture and also naming
        children.
