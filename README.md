# Ghanaian Cultural Naming App

## Introduction

This web application introduces users to a unique aspect of Ghanaian cultureâ€”the tradition of naming children based on the day of the week they were born. This app allows users to enter their date of birth and gender to discover their Ghanaian name according to this cultural practice.

## Features

-   **Date of Birth Input:** Users can select their birth date using a calendar input.
-   **Gender Selection:** Users can choose their gender from male, female, or other to receive the most culturally appropriate name.
-   **Name Display:** After submitting their details, users receive the Ghanaian name corresponding to the day of the week on which they were born.
-   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and accessible on a variety of devices, ensuring a wide audience can enjoy learning about Ghanaian culture.

## Technologies

-   **HTML:** Structures the web content and layout.
-   **CSS:** Provides styling to make the application visually appealing and ensure content is readable and accessible.
-   **Bootstrap 5:** Utilized for responsive design elements and styled components like forms and buttons.
-   **JavaScript (Placeholder):** For future enhancements, like calculating and displaying names dynamically without a page reload.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/kennedy-ben/week-two-project.git 
    
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd week-two-projec' 
    
3.  **Open the HTML file in a browser:** Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view and interact with the application.

## How It Works

The application uses a simple HTML form to gather user inputs (date of birth and gender). Upon form submission, traditionally, a JavaScript function (not included in the initial setup but mentioned as a placeholder for functionality) would calculate the name based on the day of the week and the gender selected. The result is then displayed on the same page, allowing users to learn their Ghanaian name.

## Future Enhancements

-   **JavaScript Integration:** Implement the logic to dynamically calculate and display the Ghanaian name based on user inputs without needing to refresh the page.
-   **Database Integration:** Store a wider range of names and cultural details to provide more comprehensive insights into Ghanaian naming traditions.
-   **Localization:** Offer the application in multiple languages to cater to a global audience interested in Ghanaian culture.
